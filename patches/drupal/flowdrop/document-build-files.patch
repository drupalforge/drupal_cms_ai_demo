+### JavaScript Build Files
+
+The build process generates two JavaScript bundles in `modules/flowdrop_ui/build/flowdrop/`:
+
+| File | Format | Used By |
+|------|--------|---------|
+| `flowdrop.iife.js` | IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) | **Drupal** - loaded via library system |
+| `flowdrop.es.js` | ES Modules (`import`/`export`) | Bundler-based projects (Vite, Webpack) |
+
+#### Which File Does Drupal Use?
+
+Drupal's asset system uses traditional `<script>` tags, not ES modules. Therefore,
+**Drupal loads `flowdrop.iife.js`**.
+
+#### Patching FlowDrop in Drupal
+
+If you need to patch FlowDrop behavior for a Drupal site:
+
+1. Patch `flowdrop.iife.js` (not `.es.js`)
+2. Clear Drupal caches: `drush cr`
+3. Hard refresh browser to bypass JS cache
+
+To verify which file is loaded, check browser DevTools → Network tab → filter by "flowdrop".
